### Git Commit Conventions

We follow Conventional Commits specification.

- NEVER include AI tool attribution or Co-Authored-By trailers in commit messages
- Write clean, conventional commit messages following the format: `type(scope): subject`
  - **type**: The type of change (feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore)
  - **scope**: The feature or module being worked on (optional but recommended)
  - **subject**: A concise description of what was done
    - **Important**: The subject line should account for all staged files in the commit
    - If the subject line cannot summarize all changes in a short sentence, prioritize the most impactful change to the project
    - All changes should still be detailed in the commit message body
- Include the feature being worked on in the scope, and if appropriate, a concise description of what was done
- **Commit message body**: After the first line, include a traditional bulleted list summarizing the key changes made in the commit
  - **Important**: The body should list all significant changes, ensuring all staged files are represented
  - If many files were changed, group related changes together in the bulleted list

**Examples:**

Single-line (for simple changes):
```
feat(build): add support for custom output paths
```

Multi-line with bulleted list (for more complex changes):
```
docs(ai-rules): update code quality rules with comprehensive guidelines

- Add detailed line length guidance with readability emphasis
- Add examples for comments, strings, and inline statements
- Add comprehensive Python version compatibility guidelines
- Add detailed static checks, type checking, formatting, linting, and tests section
- Add checkpoint commit guidance with prompt template
- Reference git_conventions.mdc for commit messages
```

Other examples:
- `fix(config): resolve validation error for empty build configs`
- `refactor(utils): simplify path normalization logic`
- `test(integration): add tests for log level handling`
