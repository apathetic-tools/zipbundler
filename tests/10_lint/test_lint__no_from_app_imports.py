"""Custom lint rule: Enforce `import <mod> as mod_<mod>` pattern in tests.

This test acts as a "poor person's linter" since we can't create custom ruff rules yet.
It enforces that ALL test files use `import {{project_name}}.module as mod_module` format
instead of `from {{project_name}}.module import ...` when importing from our project.

CRITICAL: This rule applies to ALL imports from our project, including private
functions (those starting with _). There are NO exceptions.

Why this matters:
- runtime_swap: Tests can run against either installed package or standalone
  single-file script. The `import ... as mod_*` pattern ensures the module object
  is available for runtime swapping.
- patch_everywhere: Predictive patching requires module objects to be available
  at the module level. Using `from ... import` breaks this because the imported
  function is no longer associated with its module object.

If you need to test private functions, import the module and access the function
via the module object: `mod_utils._private_function()` instead of importing
the function directly.
