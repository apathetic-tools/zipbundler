"""Custom lint rules: Enforce naming and documentation for private function tests.

This test file acts as a "poor person's linter" since we can't create custom ruff
rules yet. It enforces two critical rules for test files that are PRIMARILY
testing private functions.

IMPORTANT: These rules apply ONLY to test files that are primarily a test suite
for a private function. If your test file calls a private function as a helper
but is primarily testing something else, use inline ignore comments instead.

Rule 1: Naming Convention
  Test files that are primarily testing a private function (e.g., the test suite
  is primarily asserting against `mod_x._private_function()`) and have top-level
  ignore comments must be named
  `test_priv__<function name without leading underscore>.py`.

Example:
    - Function: `_compile_glob_recursive`
    - Filename: `test_priv__compile_glob_recursive.py`

  This naming convention makes it immediately clear which private function a test
  file is primarily testing, improving code discoverability and maintainability.

Rule 2: Required Ignore Comments
  All test files named `test_priv__*.py` MUST include these ignore comments at the top:
    - `# we import '_' private for testing purposes only`
    - `# ruff: noqa: SLF001`
    - `# pyright: reportPrivateUsage=false`

  These comments:
    - Document that private access is intentional for testing
    - Suppress linter warnings about accessing private members
    - Suppress type checker warnings about private usage

  Without these comments, linters and type checkers will flag private function
  access as violations, making it impossible to test private implementation details.

When to use inline ignores instead:
  If your test file is NOT primarily testing a private function (e.g., it tests
  public APIs but happens to call a private helper function), you should use
  inline ignore comments on those specific calls instead of top-level ignores
  and the `test_priv__*.py` naming convention.

Example:
    ```python
    # test_some_feature.py (not test_priv__*.py)
    def test_feature():
        result = mod_utils.public_function()
        # Private helper called but not the primary thing under test
        helper_result = mod_utils._private_helper()  # noqa: SLF001
        assert result == expected
    ```

Why these rules matter:
  - Discoverability: Clear naming makes it easy to find test suites for specific
    private functions
  - Documentation: Required comments make it explicit that private access is
    intentional
  - Consistency: Enforces a uniform pattern across all private function test
    suites
  - Tool compatibility: Ensures linters and type checkers don't flag
    intentional private access
